I am sharing few of my python projects which I have developed and still developing along my self-learning journey.
Few were for college grades, more are for fun!!!

In the README, I am listing brief description of handful of these projects.

## **6 Degrees Of Separation**
Six degrees of separation is the theory that any person on the planet can be connected to any other person on the planet through a chain of acquaintances that has no more than five intermediaries. To test it I have taken facebook data in file facebook_combined.txt.gz. 
This is in edge list representation. Here anonymous people 
are taken as nodes and edge between any two nodes 
represents friendship between them. Now, we have to prove
the theory of Six Degrees of Separation. 

 **Modules Used :** networkx, numpy
